# AutoSkip TCS iON Videos

Automate the process of skipping to the next video on the TCS iON Hub.

## Description

No more manual clicks to progress through video lessons (I am just too lazy to press the next button everytime the 5-second video ends) - this script automates the process for you. It detects the "Next" button on video pages and clicks it as soon as it becomes visible.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the Tampermonkey extension installed in your browser.
2. Then copy and paste the code in AutoSkip_TCS.user.js in TamperMonkey.
3. Save it and enjoy. :)

## Usage

1. Visit the TCS iON Hub and navigate to a video lesson.
2. The script will automatically click the "Next" button when it becomes visible.

**Disclaimer:** Please don't skip through the video because of this.
